# Image Component

In this repo we have two examples of the wrong way and correct way to use an image in a view file. Inside the [wrong-image](https://github.com/JamieDawson/Bixby-clickable-components-fixes/tree/master/image/wrong_image) repo, if you run the training `Show me an image`, the image that appears will flash when you click on it. To solve this, all we do is use the example code in [right-image](https://github.com/JamieDawson/Bixby-clickable-components-fixes/tree/master/image/right_image) repo and add `lightbox-enabled(false)` to your code.
